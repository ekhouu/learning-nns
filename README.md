# About this repo

This serves as my monorepo for learning the basics about ML, DL, however you want to spin it.
I have no background in this topic, and have so far been following the VERY EARLY lectures from [CMU's 11-785](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F25/index.html) for Fall 2025.
I do not think that I am going to follow this course by the letter, but I like the lecturer's style and have been learning a lot so far.

## Directories

```bash
00recog
 |-- neuron.cpp
```

Currently I am creating an extremely simple network for elementary glyph recognition.
My foundations for this are just lecture material so... don't judge too harshly if you come across this haha I'm trying my best to implement it all on my own.

- Went w/ slightly superfluous OOP approach for this because I want to focus on NN theory rn
- Will probably re-implement as matrix multiplication after I've got it working
